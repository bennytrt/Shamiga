# Shamiga
Shamiga! What Is Shamiga? Well, Shamiga (short for Sharp Amiga) Is An Amiga Emulator Made In C#! I Know C++ Is Better Etc Etc, But Who Cares! I Don't Have Enough C++ Knowledge Yet! So Maybe We'll See A Shamiga++ Sooner Or Later! Your Help Is Always Appreciated, And I Will Look Over Any Pull Request, And See If It Will Make Shamiga Better Or Not, i started this project a month or so ago.
